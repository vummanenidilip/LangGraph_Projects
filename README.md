# LangGraph_Projects
# LangGraph Use Case Collection

This repository contains a curated collection of practical use cases built using **LangGraph**, an agentic workflow framework built on top of **LangChain**. Each example demonstrates how to leverage LangGraph to structure multi-step reasoning, tool usage, and agent orchestration using LLMs in a modular and composable way.

## üîç Overview

LangGraph extends LangChain by allowing developers to build dynamic, graph-based workflows for LLM agents. These use cases cover various real-world scenarios, including:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **Question Answering with Grading & Rewriting**
- **Multi-agent Decision Making**
- **Custom Tool Integration**
- **LLM-Driven Document Processing**

Each use case is self-contained and illustrates a different aspect of building intelligent, tool-aware, and controllable AI agents.

## üß∞ Technologies Used
